## Implmementation of Deep Learning Architectures on Pytorch

In this Repository some basic DL architectures will be implemented from scratch. 
For every one of them, there will be a Jupyter notebook exlpaining the implementation and ideas behind the given architecture.

They will also be implemented as individual classes inside de `api` folder for later use.

Every architecture will also have an example notebook where it will be shown how this particular architecture can be used for some specific task.



The purpose of this project is to serve as a personal guide of DL architectures for myself, but i encourage anyone that likes this code to use it and to give me feedback on how to improve it.
