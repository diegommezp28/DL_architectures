## Classic ML Algorithms

It is not a bad idea to review some basic ML algorithms, their use cases and implementations in common libraries such as Scikit-Learn, Scipy, Torch, Keras, etc

This is the list of the algorithms and techniques that i wish to review:

- [ ] Logistic Regression, Linear Regression
- [ ] Naive Bayes
- [ ] K-means, KNN
- [ ] Decition Trees, Random Forests, XGBoost
- [ ] SVM
- [ ] Dimensionality Reduction
